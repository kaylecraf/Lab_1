Questions!!

1. These statements are not equivalent. Firsly, the order of the columns in the data frame would be different seeing as the resulting dataset has the columns from the 
first argument and then is extended for the second argument. Additonally, the output geometry would be different. For the stations that intersect with counties the output
would be points, each representing a station that falls within a county. For the counties that intersect with stations, the output would be polygons representing the counties
that have stations within them. 

2. Task 4 was most definitely the hardest. Figuring out how to intersect the datasets correctly was a challenge but rewarding once I figured it out. Aditionally, using the
mutate function to add columns to datasets was new to me. We probably went over it in class and I forgot but it was still fun to figure out.

3. I want to make more fun plots and graphs. I love a figure so the more of that the better.
